# YOLO_OpenCV_Face_Blurring_Pipeline

#OVERVIEW

This repository walks through a Face Detection and Blurring Pipeline applied to historical photographs, using YOLO-Face and OpenCV. It includes a sample dataset from the Boston Globe Photograph Morgue (source: Northeastern University Special Archives & Collections) for testing and evaluation purposes. This code is designed to support the archival workflow, particularly in application to image anonymization and de-identification tasks in news archives. However, it can be applied to other photograph collections from historical archives in GLAMs.
